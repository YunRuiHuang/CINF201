**QUESTION**: what would be the difference if we used integer vs float, or visa versa?



**A**: If we use the integer, All the input would be converted to an integer, which means the float input (such as 10.01) would be converted to an integer (as 10). Same as the float, the integer (such as 10) would be converted to float (as 10.00). That means, if we convert float to integer, it may lose data after the decimal point.
