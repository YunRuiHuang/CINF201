## Question

- **If you have two divs that are both set to 90% width and one is within the other (i.e. one is a child div and the other is the parent div), how much of the screen would each take up?**

- A: the parent div will be 90% width of screen, child div would be 90% width of parent page, so it is  90%*90% = 81% width of screen.
